- Economic problems: ravaged country, collapsed monetary system,
economic breakdown
- Political problems: lack of support from coastal and southern China
- Social problems: dislocation, poverty, crimes
CCP’s first steps to recovery
- Construct a socialist country
- Secure alliance with Soviet Union

 Land reforms (1950-1952)
- Million of landlords were killed
- Three Anti (san fan) Anti corruption, waste, and bureaucracy

- The agricultural cooperatives purchased grain with very low price.
- The Party-state used hukou scheme to exclude peasants from welfare
programs interlocked to ‘work units’.

- **Ideology:** helps analyse how the authorities inculcate ideas and
beliefs that serve to legitimize the authorities’ interest into people’s
mind through consent and manipulation (Gilmartin 2009:136-137).
- **Hegemony** describes a form of power gained through consent and
coercion

- The failure of top-down approach to developing technology and
economy in a totalitarian regime.
- What worked out in Soviet Union does not necessarily work out in
China.
- The excessive use of coercive means to consolidate one-party rule
(local cadres, technicians, and intellectuals were too afraid to tell the
truth)
- The stress of socialist ideology also undermined the leadership’s and
the experts’ evaluation of technology policies.

Just as the Korean economy was dominated by a small number of large-
scale chaebol, so too would a relatively small number of enterprise groups
dominate the Chinese economy. Moreover, just as management of the Korean
economy was highly centralized, the Chinese plan eliminated the multiplic-
ity of bureaucratic interests, centralizing control in the SETC. Finally, just
as small-scale enterprise was left to the market in Korea, so the central state
would retreat from ownership and management of most industry in China.

Jiang Zemin had long been a supporter of China’s entry into the WTO, as a
way both of tying China’s economy more closely to the world’s and of demon-
strating his ability to enhance China’s status as a world power. However, many
bureaucracies in China feared the impact of joining the trade organization, and
Li Peng had effectively blocked serious negotiations.


The reaction in China to the failed WTO agreement and to the publication of
details was both strong and immediate. Wu Jichuan, Minister of Information
Industries (which includes telecommunications), reportedly tendered his res-
ignation (which was not accepted).

In the wake of the WTO failure and the embassy bombing, Zhu Rongji
was abused mercilessly by public opinion. Articles on the Internet and stu-
dent demonstrators labeled him a “traitor” (maiguozei) following the embassy
bombing.

Globalization.

 The result, Fang concluded, was that
“whether from a macro-perspective or a micro-perspective, the United States’
cultural expansion is bound tightly with its economic expansion, so that in the
course of economic exchange it [cultural expansion] can achieve the effect of
‘politics in command’ (zhengzhi guashuai).”

**Reforming China’s Embedded Socialist Compromise: China and the WTO**

 the deal that was finally signed by the Chinese is
in some ways a mirror image of these motivations, in that it entails the opening up of markets that will threaten the interests of many domestic producers, while providing other states with considerable protection from a possible rise of Chinese imports.

I suggest, then, that a study of China’s WTO entry negotiations reveals a shift in what I call the ‘embedded socialist compromise’ that dictates the relationship between domestic economic reform and international institutional norms in the Chinese polity.

Notwithstanding the significance of nationalism, the largest area of concern, and the biggest source of domestic political opposition to entry, came from more pragmatic fears over the implications of entry for key sectors of the Chinese economy.

 In urban sectors, the palliative was to gradually replace
the provision of grants through the planning system to maintain production in state-owned
enterprises with the extension of loans through the banking and financial system. In the
countryside, the provision of subsidies for producers has also been more recently supple-
mented by the extension of loans through the financial system, particularly as many
small-scale township and village enterprises turned from being engines of economic growth to drains on the financial system in the late 1990s.


It might be true, as a 1995 report in The Economist put it, that ‘Were it any average-sized
developing country, China would have been admitted years ago’.27 It is also true that China
‘has, in many ways, a more open economy than, say, Japan or South Korea at a comparable
stage of development’.28 But this is beside the point. China is not just an average-sized
developing country. It is a large state, with a potentially lucrative market, which ran large
trade surpluses with the EU and the United States throughout the negotiation process. It is
also a state with a human rights record that is the subject of considerable criticism from
sections within the major industrialized states. 


Far from being a great success in negotiation, the Chinese deal appears to be one of the
most, if not the most, restrictive of all new entry deals. 

First, and perhaps most clearly, globalization adds more actors to the policy process in
developing states, and, it could be argued, increases the power of ‘external’ actors over state
policy. In Payne and Gamble’s words, ‘States now have to recognise the power not only
of other states and international organisations ... but also of international capital, the banks,
and foreign exchange markets.’62
Second, globalization leads to the recomposition of and renegotiation of relationships
between state actors within the national sphere. As Sassen argues, the effects of economic
globalization often ‘materialize in national territories’63 and ‘the strategic spaces where
global processes are embedded are often national; the mechanisms through which new legal
forms, necessary for globalization, are implemented are often part of national state
institutions’.64

Sassen’s main
emphasis was on the shifting balance of power between different ministries and agencies
within government. For instance, the financial agencies might gain power and influence
while others may lose. 

Those industries and sectors that stand to lose most, even under rosy assumptions, are
those where the hand of the state—or the hand of the old style of state control—still
dominates. Those that stand to gain most, in particular clothing and textiles, are sectors
where the new quasi-private sector and foreign ownership dominate.

# Week 5
## Readings
This week’s readings focused on public participation within the Chinese government. Tony Saich’s “Political Participation and Protest” provides an overview of political participation in China in different eras of the PRC. In the Mao era, the principal of the mass line allowed consultation with the masses in policy formulation, but this still required adherence to revolutionary ideals, severely limiting potential policy choices. The cultural revolution and Gang of Four eras meant a return to more centralized control, and later movements led to a system of limited public consultation, as long as it did not threaten Party hegemony. (Saich pp. 180-183) In the post-Mao era, economic growth has surpassed class struggle as a policy metric, and some controlled opposition such as United Front parties and limited unionization have been allowed to exist (Saich pp. 185-187). Some workplaces and villages have limited electoral politics, and protests are tolerated. 
Andrew Mertha’s “Fragmented Authoritarianism 2.0” describes social groups who gained more space to criticize government policy; officials in government agencies, those in the news media, and those inside non-governmental organizations; these policy entrepreneurs must work within the regime to amplify and articulate new policy proposals through different framings of an issue. (Mertha p. 999) From the perspective of the State, they need to provide an outlet for citizen discontent, as well as obtain new ideas and policies with minimal expenditure. The author beings up hydropower as an illustration of these processes, in which experts, the news media and environmental activists all contended for the fate of the Nu river valley. It finally became a subject of national debate, and the project was ultimately scrapped. This, in contrast to the failure of opposition to the Pubugou hydropower project, was able to show the potential influence of non-state actors. (Mertha pp. 1002-1007) The author extends this concept to industry advocacy and the cooperation between industry and government in international trade negotiations.
Finally, Shi Shih-Jiunn discusses China’s social security systems, and the interactions between the policy coordination of the central government and the financial responsibilities of localities. There is increased variation in local policies, stemming from increased autonomy afforded by the central government and an appetite for policy exploration. (Shi  pp. 74-75) This decentralization manifests in competitive solidarity – contention within large markets without  protectionism or reliance on redistribution. Regional protectionism still exists, for example, in the form of restrictions such as the Hukou system. These institutional dynamics show that the forces in Chinese government are both between people and the State and between different regional governments.

**Studying the Chinese Policy Process in the Era of ‘Top-Level Design’: the Contribution of ‘Political Steering’ Theory**
Gunter Schubert 1 & Björn Alpermann 2

Chinese policy process has mostly been concerned with individual policy instru-
ments or various modes of policy-making so far instead of looking at how these
are interconnected. In this article, we propose ‘political steering theory’ as an
integrative theoretical framework to fill in this gap.

‘Political steering’ theory goes back to the work of German sociologist Renate Mayntz and
9political scientist Fritz Scharpf starting in the 1970s. From the outset, they described
‘political steering’ as a mode of policy-making that attempts to resolve identified social, economic and political problems within a given society by purpose-driven and goal-oriented state intervention or guidance of policy-implementation at all administrative tiers
of a political system in a top-down fashion. 


 China developed its distinctive
mode of ‘multi-level steering’ in which local governments are ‘steering objects’ from
the perspective of the center, but ‘steering subjects’ in their own right vis-à-vis their
subordinate jurisdictions. 

We also distinguish between ‘steering capacity’ on the part of the state and
‘governability’22 on the part of the ‘steering objects’. At an abstract level, the latter
term refers to steering objects’ overall amenability to steering efforts by upper levels
and encompasses avoidance strategies (coping, shirking) and counter-steering strategies
(see below) they employ. Defined in this way, it becomes clear that steering capacity
and governability are but two sides of one coin: the former is conditioned by the latter
and vice versa.

We distinguish between four ideal types of steering modes (hard steering, negotia-
tion, competition, soft steering), an open list of steering instruments, a number of
steering tactics – including coalition-building and political campaigning [41] – and
different actors involved in political steering (or counter-steering), including state and
corporate, collective and individual social actors. 

We argue that under Xi Jinping the hierarchical mode has been revitalized and made
more central to policymaking under ‘top-level design’, i.e. the meta-steering approach
has been recalibrated. First, several high-powered ‘leading small groups’ (LSGs) have
been added to the central party organization, most notably the one on ‘comprehensively
deepening reforms’ with its nearly unlimited remit. 

 First, several high-powered ‘leading small groups’ (LSGs) have
been added to the central party organization, most notably the one on ‘comprehensively
deepening reforms’ with its nearly unlimited remit. 

Second, the control aspect of hierarchical steering has been systematically strength-
ened since the takeover of Xi Jinping. OObviously, the whole anti-corruption drive and
heightened ideological mobilization are means to enhance the steering subject’s control
capacity [48]. From the perspective of steering theory, these are necessary and comple-
mentary measures and instruments applied by the central state to improve its meta-
steering capacity: As a steering subject, the political center needs to be able to effectively
monitor local state actors’ behavior and enforce its policy line.


A third aspect of ‘top-level design’ is that policy fields, which are in themselves
already complex and multifaceted, are recombined into even larger macro-policy fields
for which longer-range and highly ambitious plans are being crafted. The idea is to
overcome fragmentation between different vertically organized administrations (xitong)
by providing an authoritative blueprint that stipulates policy goals, if not the concrete
measures to achieve them.


**Integrated Fragmentation and the Role of Leading Small Groups in Chinese Politics** Wen-Hsuan Tsai and Wang Zhou*

Seen from another perspective, China, as an authoritarian state, is unlikely to
let fragmented authoritarianism thrive, unless it suffers a loss of central author-
ity. So there is likely to be a mechanism for holding departmental interests at bay
so that superiors’ policies can be promoted effectively. We believe that leading
small groups (领导小组 lingdao xiaozu) are an important mechanism to accom-
plish this end.6

In the past, academics have had little access to information on
leading small groups, mainly because their structures and operations were not
made public. But we did know that the CCP government has frequently used
leading small groups to implement its policies. 

Leading small groups consist of four main elements. First, there is the group
leader, the choice of whom reflects the leading small group’s importance. Second,
there are the constituent departments, of which there may be many, depending
on the nature of the group’s tasks. The heads of these departments become mem-
bers of the leading small group. Third, there is the lead department, the most im-
portant of the various constituent departments in the leading small group. Finally,
there is the group office—the organization that performs the day-to-day tasks and
routine administrative work of the leading small group. 

 the replacement and promotion of Chinese bureaucrats
is mostly managed by the Party, meaning that higher-level officials control the ap-
pointment of lower-level officials.21 Some scholars believe that the nomenklatura
system is the most important way in which high-level officials get their subordi-
nates to carry out their wishes,22 as group leaders often are able to exert power over
the future careers of department heads.

Another method of punishment is to submit a “report” (通报 tongbao) on the
offender. Such reports are one of the ways in which the CCP maintains discipline
within its organizations.

Another formal source of authority for group leaders is their administrative
rank. For leading small groups with important and/or sensitive tasks, the CCP is
most likely to select high-level officials as group leaders.

The creation of cross-system leading small groups clearly shows that the Chi-
nese government is aware that if it is to tackle tough issues in its reform agenda, it
must establish consolidated high-level organizations. In CCP terminology, they
must establish “decision-making and coordination institutions” (决策议事协调
机构 juece yishi xiediao jigou).49 This also implies that China’s reforms can no
longer progress merely by “crossing the river by feeling for stones.

he New Model of Group Politics and High-Level Decision Making
After Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, he personally took over the key positions
in several of the most important leading small groups. In addition to leading the Central Commission for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms, the Central Cyber-
security and Informatization Commission, the National Security Commission, and
the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission, he made sure that some
of his most trusted associates were appointed heads of leading small groups or di-
rectors of cross-system leading small group offices.
The leading small group system is the most important coordination and
decision-making mechanism that the CCP uses to integrate the work of various
government departments.

In conclusion, high-level policy making in Xi’s period shows features that are
at considerable variance from what prevailed during Jiang’s and Hu’s adminis-
trations. The new form of leading small group politics is founded on and pro-
motes Xi’s unrivaled power, undercutting the Politburo and State Council, and
carries heavy overtones of one-man rule and a personality cult.

Kuruvilla, Sarosh. (2011). ‘Introduction and Argument.’ In Sarosh Kuruvilla et
al. (eds). **From Iron Rice Bowl to Informalization: Markets, Workers, and the State in a Changing China.**

Zhang, Lu. (2011). **The Paradox of Labour Force Dualism and State-Labour-dCapital Relations in the Chinese Automobile Industry.** 

Chapter 1 of From Iron Rice Bowl to Informalization: Markets, Workers, and the State in a Changing China (Kuruvilla, 2011) explains how and why informal labor in China expanded along with it’s economic growth.  This move to informal employment occurred in three phases. First, “denationalization,” increased autonomy for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), led to increased flexibility in who managers could hire. This also created a stronger profit motive for these enterprises, who wanted to attract foreign and private investment. The need for leaner business models led to an increased dependence on informal labor. Second, the 1995 National Labor Law permitted short-term contracts and reduced the responsibilities of enterprises to provide for those under their employ, and made it easier to fire people, this “smashing the iron rice bowl.” In the third phase, the Chinese government attempted to mitigate the problems cause by these short-term contracts and preserve social security in the public (pp.4-7). In response to this decades-long shift, there has been resistance from the working class, with strikes and demonstrations concentrated around foreign-owned enterprises and SEZs (p. 7).

The State benefits from decentralization and the pro-Capital environment, as decentralized industries reduce costs for the central government, and this shifts the burden of regulation to local governments, which have handled it with uneven competence (p.8). News laws offering new protections are expensive to the government, and this is intertwined with an expansion in social insurance and social welfare, as fewer workers can rely on the iron rice bowl and retirement pensions (p. 10). Flows of capital have led to more power being held at the local level, where municipalities can extract rents from pension payments, contending with local advocacy organizations.

Chapter 6 of the same book (Zhang 2011) focuses specifically on the auto industry, which follows the trend laid out in chapter 1. Automakers faces increasing outside competition in the 1990s, and cut costs, relying on temporary workers and migrant labor. This created a system of  labor force dualism, where some workers held good jobs, and many with precarious employment (p. 108-109). This led to resistance and protest, improved conditions, and a new state-labor-capital relationship. The automobile industry was regarded as a “pillar industry” in China (p.110), and initially closely controlled by the central government, but structural changes brought it into the market economy, with looser barriers to entry and more joint ventures. This brought labor-intensive manufacturing techniques, a separation between State workers and those on informal labor contracts through agencies. Production workers were hardest hit by short-term contract work, and pushed back to gain more representation within the industry (pp. 123-125).  This was followed by the 2017 Labor Contract Law, which attempted to crack down on the shadier practices from agencies, but the labor-capital-state triangle still skews towards the latter two participants.

ANT is rooted in science and technology research conducted during the 1980s.

As an industry that remains under governmental control, the primary players represented are the central bank, the Big Four, second-tier commercial banks, and city commercial banks. China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 lead to successful IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) of commercial banks, state-owned institutions, and foreign financial institutions, as well as increased autonomy. 


Third-party payment (TPP) is the core enabler of e-commerce development. TPP Refers to payment service providers that
are independent from merchants and banks. In many countries around the world, customers use credit cards to make online
purchases. However, Chinese customers prefer cash payment, which has made China’s e-commerce unique. In addition to
credit cards and debit cards, third-party online payment and cash-on-delivery (COD) are commonly accepted methods. In
particular, third-party payment has been very important for Chinese consumers.

. Problematization (before 2003): State-owned banking system
Before 2000, the Chinese financial industry was lagging behind those of many other countries, and facing various sig-
nificant problems

However, the biggest obstacle facing these Internet companies was the payment system. At that time, transferring money
offline was done only through the two popular banks (i.e., ICBC and CMB) or the post office. Online payment had the same
problem. China was a strong “cash society,” with COD being a common payment method in China. The credit system was not
mature enough, and credit cards were not yet widely used or accepted in China (Wang, 2014).

The year 2003 was a milestone for the development of both payment systems and e-commerce in China. At that time,
Alibaba decided to start its customer-to-customer (C2C) marketplace Taobao. It operated under the same business model as
eBay, providing an online marketplace, payment solutions, and technological infrastructures to match buyers and sellers.
However, Alibaba was not equivalent to eBay in terms of revenue, brand recognition, or management team. Up until then,
Alibaba was merely an e-commerce site for SMEs conducting business online (Wang, 2014).
Based on this situation, Alibaba entered into a partnership with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the
China Construction Bank in 2009 to help facilitate loans to domestic small business customers in China. Given that 85% of all
loans went to other state-owned enterprises (SOEs), leaving little for private companies and particularly SMEs (Marr, 2015),
Alibaba’s strategy represented a potentially effective way of forming an actor network with SMEs. SMEs became interested
in the solution proposed by Alibaba because Alibaba's interest was not different from those of them.

- Developments of Internet infrastructure and information technology
across different CCP leadership
- Policies for developing IT
- Networked Authoritarianism

China in 2000
• 8.9 million Internet users
• 48,000 domain names in China (3/4 commercial)
• 125 million telephone lines
• 150 million foreign investments in Internet content-providers and e-
commerce start-ups

Internet coverage:
61.2% until 2019, Internet users are mobile internet users

Supportive policies and funds for developing internet infrastructure
since 1995, expanding the scale since 2008
- Support home-bred tech firms and ban foreign IT
- Expand internet and telecommunication infrastructure nation-wide
• 2001: has legally allowed tech firms’ to receive FDI
• 2000-2010: granted much freedom to e-commerce and fintech start-
ups


Networked authoritarianism reflects CCP’s
regime resilience
• The CCP regime is increasingly responsive and resilient based on the
scholars’ observation of China between the 1990s and 2010s (Nathan 2003,
2008).
- The regime has become more institutionalized.
1. Norm-bound succession politics
2. The increase in meritocratic as opposed to factional considerations in the
promotion of political elites
3. Differentiation and functional specialisation of institutions within the
regime
4. The establishment of institutions for political participation and appeal
that strengthen the CCP’s legitimacy among the public at large.

Liu, Lizhi and Weingast, Barry. (2018). **Taobao, Federalism, and the Emergence of Law, Chinese Style.**
On the one hand, the insufficiency of the regulatory institutions in the e-commerce industry causes slacks, so the PONCs are able to explain those incomplete institutions, which in turn causes the local government to make biased choices based on these slacks.

between the Chinese Internet
Giants and the Party-State

 China’s middle-class households reached 140 million in 2017,
accounting for 30% of the total households in China.

Why was Alibaba delisted from Hong Kong
exchange in 2012?
• Before 2018, Hong Kong exchange did not allow Dual-Class Share
Structure.
• But this policy has changed since 2018, so Alibaba Group Holding
Limited has been re-listed in Hong Kong in 2019 exchange again.

Political context of the boom of e-commerce
• Dissemination of ICT infrastructure nation-wide, but lacked a reliable
online payment system.
• Alibaba solved the problem of fragmented payment system that the state
had not been able to do so (Liu and Weingast 2019).
• In the meritocracy-based cadre promotion system, local governments take
initiatives developing local e-commerce
ØFrom 2014 onwards, many local governments have cooperated with Alibaba to
expand rural e-commerce, exemplified by the dramatic growth of Taobao villages.
ØZhejiang government chose to support Alibaba over a provincial-level SOE when
developing local e-commerce
• Alibaba was consulted when e-commerce law was drafted(Liu and
Weingast 2019).

Julian Gruin **Financializing authoritarian capitalism: Chinese fintech and the institutional foundations of algorithmic governance**

technology as a mechanism for achieving Leninist social management ... blurs divisions between public and private, and the laying of responsibility for overall social development upon the citizenry, party members, commercial enterprises, social organizations, and government officials alike (Thornton, 2007). The outcome is a form of ‘cyber-Leninism’ (Creemers, 2017b) that has in turn undergone substantial upgrading since the start of the Xi administration, a turning point in the CCP’s approach to utilizing and exploiting technology to restructure the Party’s governingframework.

 Its impact arises from the interaction of four factors: the emergence of big data credit scoring technologies, an economic growth model demanding a more open and efficient financial system, a retail market environment primed for the uptake of digital financial services, and an authoritarian and ideologically robust state apparatus seeking to maximize new opportunities for socio-economic development whilst minimizing related threats to systemic stability and authoritarian control.

Julian Gruin & Peter Knaack **Not Just Another Shadow Bank: Chinese Authoritarian Capitalism and the ‘Developmental’ Promise of Digital Financial Innovation**

Our core argument is that the underlying political economic priorities of Chinese developmentalism – deeply rooted in China’s CCP-led authoritarian capitalism – have shaped the policy response to financial innovation and regulatory arbitrage in the post-crisis financial system.


Economist **In Fintech, China shows the way**
Advanced technology, backward banks and soaring wealth make China a leader in fintech

How did ntech get so big in China? The short answer is that it was the right
thing at the right time in the right place. Even after Chinese banks tucked away
their abacuses, they remained remarkably unsophisticated for a high-speed
economy. 

 Today 95% of China’s internet users go online via mobile devices

WeChat’s mobile wallet is usable internationally, mostly in Asia for now. Ant has
invested in mobile- nance companies in India, South Korea and Thailand. 

And the biggest lesson of all: it is not upstarts versus incumbents but rather a
question of how banks absorb the ntech innovations blossoming around them.
China, an early adopter of the abacus, is, after a long period of dormancy, once
again blazing a trail in nance.

Authoritarian capitalism
interactions between authoritarian state and corporations

Authoritarian capitalism:
Weak rule of law
State intervention
Limited public participation

Key point of Gruin and Knaack:

- SOCB model is outdated; shdow banking and fintech emerged formed after restrictions from the financial crisis bailouts 
- shadow banking is not really in the shadows; WMPs and internet banking  and other fintech are a from of "stealth liberalization" but still subject to CCP authority and goals.
- CCP's goals are manifest in bounds of fintech; economic development and political control

Why AC not SC?
- state capitalism implies 

Why is autoritarian caputalism a more useful cpsitalism more useful than state capitalsim when analyzing the interactions between fintech firms and chinese authorities?

Authoritarian capitalism implies 
Weak rule of law:
"Stealth liberalization" means that the State is not in control of the whole problem
Private companies are choosing to cooperate with the government, instead of following gov't initiatives

- Development of fintech in China
- The centralising regulatory framework towards the fintech industry
- The lens of authoritarian capitalism

**From 2000-2009: laissez-faire approach** Potentially inspires the Western practice of ‘Fintech Regulatory Sandbox’


2010 ‘Regulation towards Non-Bank Institutions regarding Providing Payment Services’ (Directive of People’s Bank of China [2010]No.2). Must apply Digital Payment Licences granted by the central bank. In May 2011, 27 firms (mostly TPP firms) received licences.

Foreign-invested fintech firms had little chance of
obtaining licences until a new regulation in 2018

- Jack Ma separated AliPay from
Alibaba Group

- TenPay and China UnionPay
Merchant Services sold foreign
shares

• From March 2015 to June 2020, the number of TPP licences declined
from 270 to 237, meaning that 33 TPP service providers lost their
licences.
• Causes: money laundry, embezzlement of escrow money, forge
annual financial and business reports

2017
• The Fifth National Financial Work Conference
• Has required payments of TPP companies which previously processed
bilaterally with commercial banks to be transferred into a centralised
clearance system (wanglian).


The lens of authoritarian capitalism

• Witt and Redding (2014): authoritarian
capitalism in China
• Focuses on the financial system,
business system and interactions
between the authoritarian state and
corporations.
• Features:
1. Weak rule of law
2. State intervention
3. Limited public participation
